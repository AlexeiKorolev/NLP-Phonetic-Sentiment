green

roses
too
i
see
them
bloom
for
me
and
for
you

i
think
to
myself
what
a
wonderful
world

of
blue
and
clouds
of
white
the
bright
blessed
days
dark
sacred
nights
and
i
think
to
myself
what
a
wonderful
world

colors
of
the
rainbow

pretty
in
the
sky

of
